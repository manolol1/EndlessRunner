# EndlessRunner

Endless Runner game *(similar to the Chrome T-Rex game, just worse)*, made with libGDX.

## Running Instructions

### Java Executable (any Desktop OS, JVM required)

For this method, a Java Runtime needs to be installed.

1. Make sure that a Java Runtime is installed. There are lots of guides on the internet for this.
2. Download the latest .jar file from the release tab.
3. Run the .jar file with Java. Sometimes, this can be done by double-clicking the file.
   If that doesn't work, you probably need to execute it by running `java -jar EndlessRunner-version.jar` in a terminal. *make sure to use the correct file name*


### APK File (Android)

1. Download the latest .apk file from the release tab. This file must be placed somewhere on your Android device. I recommend the Downloads folder.
2. Install the apk using a file browser. **Google Play Protect might block the installation. You need to tap on "more details" and then on "install anyway".**
